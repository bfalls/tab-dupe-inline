# Privacy Policy

Tab Dupe Inline does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.

The extension operates entirely locally in the browser and only performs actions explicitly initiated by the user, such as duplicating and closing tabs.

No analytics, tracking, logging, or external network requests are used.

If you have questions about this policy, you can review the source code on GitHub.
